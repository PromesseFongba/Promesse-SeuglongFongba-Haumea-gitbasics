        <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I have always found inspiration in the quote, "life is like a roller coaster; it has its ups and downs, but it's your choice to scream or enjoy the ride." My life's journey has indeed resembled a roller coaster, shaped by my background and socioeconomic status. I was born in Cameroon, Africa, in a family with nine kids, and I'm the seventh. Now, I'm 30 years old, a mom to two kids (four and one-year-old), and I've been married since November 2017. Even though my family didn't have a lot of money when I was growing up, I never gave up on my dream of becoming a software engineer because I love working with technology. I recently moved to the United States, embarking on a new chapter of exploration and learning. <br>Family is super important to me, and I cherish every moment I spend with them. I also really enjoy being outside, whether it's taking a walk in the park or having a picnic on the weekends. So, as I start this new phase of my life, I'm looking forward to the new experiences and opportunities it brings. Beyond academics, I have a flair for cooking. I find it extremely satisfying to experiment with new recipes and techniques, often inspired by the cooking shows I love to watch. The art of preparing delicious meals truly captivates me.</p>
